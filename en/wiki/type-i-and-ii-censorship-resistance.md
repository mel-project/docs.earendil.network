# Type-I and II censorship resistance

We can distinguish between two types of censorship resistance:

* **Type-I** or _filter resistance_ prevents discrimination between different users or different data use cases within the same protocol, by the infrastructure that operates the protocol (e.g. Ethereum RPC nodes)
* **Type-II** or _ban resistance_ prevents the protocol itself from being banned by powerful adversaries that control _underlying_ infrastructure (e.g. ISPs, nation states)

Many crypto\* projects have pretty strong Type-I censorship resistance, such as Tor, privacy coins, etc.

Some communication projects (like Tor pluggable transport) try to achieve Type-II censorship resistance at the cost of massive centralization that makes Type-I censorship resistance much harder.

Few projects try to achieve both; Earendil is an exception.
