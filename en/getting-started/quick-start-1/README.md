# Quick Start

## Run a node

* **Relays** form the backbone of the Earendil network. They serve other nodes on the network by relaying messages for them.
* **Clients** do not relay any traffic, and they access the network with the help of relays. They cannot be neighbors with other clients.

You can read more about Earendil's architecture in the wiki's [Network architecture section](https://docs.earendil.network/wiki/architecture).
