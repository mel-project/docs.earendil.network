# GUI

## Usage

After launching the GUI, you should see the default "Dashboard" tab:

As you can see, there is currently no information available in our graph dump. This is because our node is disconnected. In order to start it up, let go over to the "Settings" tab.

From here we can paste the example configuration from the [quick start instructions](./#config-file). If our config file is correct we will see "config successfully validated!" in green.

Now that we have configured our node, we can start it by clicking the "Start" button in the tray at the bottom of the screen. Once we've started our node, we can head over to the "Logs" tab to see the node's current activity and state.

We can also check the "Dashboard" tab again to see information about our identity, our neighbors, and the overall relay graph of the network.

Finally, we can head over to the "Chat" tab to start chatting with any of our direct neighbors by clicking on the button with their fingerprint.
